  //About
  ABOUT_ME_TITLE: 'About me',
  ABOUT_ME_CONTENT: `I have over 2 years of professional experience as a software engineer, and have worked for startups to medium-sized organizations.
  While I am proficient as a full-stack engineer, my expertise is in building scalable backend services(API services, async mechanisms).
  I'm most familiar with C# and the .Net framework, but picking a new framework or language is no problemo.
  likewise, I love building things from scratch putting in a lot of thought before hand and making proper software designs to address future problems.`,
